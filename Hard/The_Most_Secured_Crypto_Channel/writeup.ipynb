    "First of all, I would suggest reading about bb84. This [writeup](https://devel0pment.de/?p=1533) about another challenge was very explanatory on how quantum key distribution works. Also, read this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution).</br> \n",
    "If you examine the first transmission file (transmission1.txt), and think about what you have just read, you can see that the symbols {/, \\\\, |, -} represent the degress of the qbit stream.</br>\n",
    "The second transmission file (transmission2.txt) represents the used basis as it includes {+, x} symbols.</br>\n",
    "I didn't really use the third file to solve the challenge.</br>\n",
    "We use the first two transmission files to extract the initial bit stream."
